This repository contains a collection of bioinformatics algorithms that I developed as part of a course at San Diego University. The algorithms are implemented in Python and cover a range of topics in bioinformatics.

Here's a brief overview of the algorithms included:

1. `PatternMatching`: This function takes a pattern and a genome as input and returns all starting positions in the genome where the pattern appears.

2. `FrequencyMap`: This function takes a text and an integer 'k' as input and returns a frequency map of all 'k'-mers in the text.

3. `ReverseComplement`: This function takes a DNA pattern as input and returns its reverse complement.

4. `PatternCount`: This function takes a text and a pattern as input and returns the number of times the pattern appears in the text.

5. `FasterSymbolArray`: This function takes a genome and a symbol as input and returns an array tracking the net count of the symbol in the genome.

6. `SkewArray`: This function takes a genome as input and returns an array tracking the difference between the counts of 'G' and 'C' in the genome.

7. `MinimumSkew`: This function takes a genome as input and returns all positions in the genome achieving the minimum skew.

8. `HammingDistance`: This function takes two strings 'p' and 'q' as input and returns the Hamming distance between them.

9. `ApproximatePatternMatching`: This function takes a text, a pattern, and an integer 'd' as input and returns all starting positions in the text where the pattern appears with at most 'd' mismatches.

10. `ApproximatePatternCount`: This function takes a pattern, a text, and an integer 'd' as input and returns the number of times the pattern appears in the text with at most 'd' mismatches.
